Stable vs Unstable Sorting
==========================

Some of these algorithms are stable by definition. If the relative order of duplicate elements is preserved as a result of sorting algorithm, it's stable. If it's not then elements will be switched anyways.

Why do we care? Imagine if instead of ordering simple numbers, like in the examples, what if we were ordering objects instead of primitive integers? For example, a sort within a sort.
