## Introduction

There's probably only as much as we can do without
learning the most basic algorithms and data structures.
In this repo, you'll find implementations and exaplanations
of the performance of each of this algorithms, along with
walk through examples.



## Abstract data type

Is a mathematical model for data types, where
a data type is defined by it's behaviour (semantics)
from the point of view of a user of the data, specially
in the terms of possible values, possible operations on
data of this type, and the behaviour of these operations.

* Abstract description of how specific data can be organized
* Doesn't have a connection or concrete implementation.
* They are more linked to mathematical abstractions.
* ADT can describe a stack as a data type which allows to
store data and perform Push, Pop, and Peek operations (for ex.)
but without digging into the details.

## Data structure

Is a data organization, management and storage
format that enables efficient access and modification.
More precisely, a data structure is a collection of
data values, the relationships among them, and the
functions or operations that can be applied to the data.s

* Is a concrete implementation of an ADT
* A Stack has an ADT definition, an a concrete implementation.
